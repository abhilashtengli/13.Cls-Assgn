# Catch Me If You Can Game

A simple web-based game where you have to catch a moving box. The box moves to a random position within the viewport whenever the mouse cursor hovers over it.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

2. You will see a box with the text "Catch me!!" on it.

3. Move your mouse cursor over the box to try and catch it.

4. The box will move to a random position within the viewport every time you hover over it.

5. Try to catch the box as many times as you can!

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The HTML file that contains the game interface.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that defines the styles and appearance of the game.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the game logic.

## How it Works

The JavaScript code in `script.js` listens for the `mouseover` event on the box element. When you hover over the box, it generates a new random position within the viewport and moves the box to that position.


Have fun catching the moving box!
